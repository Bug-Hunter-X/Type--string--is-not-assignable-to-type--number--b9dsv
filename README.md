This TypeScript code demonstrates a common type error. The functions `add` and `subtract` are correctly typed to accept and return numbers.  However, if you were to try and assign a string to the result variable, you would encounter a type error. This is because TypeScript's type system prevents incompatible assignments. The solution shows how to fix the error by ensuring that only numbers are assigned to number type variables.
